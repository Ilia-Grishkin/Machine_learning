    "The main problem which may be associated with Ireland’s economy is currently experiencing severe housing crisis. Housing prices is big part of a country's economy and it affects many others sectors. This issue has deep roots, as was mentioned by Nowlan (2016) and Scuffil (2022), this crisis is going back to 1900s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lyons, R. (2018) point out that property market is a regular topic of national attention in Ireland. For majority house owners their house is most valuable assets.\n",

    "Ireland's economy has been suffering one of the most severe housing busts of the global financial crisis (Norris and Byrne M. (2017), however in recent years been represented as having recovered economically (Nowicki et al.,\n",
    "2019). Since 2013, Irish house prices have increased by 50%, while rent rates have grown by over 60% according to Byrne  M. (2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "The pricing of houses is being affected by many different factors, such as the location of the house, the features in the house and condition Phan, T. (2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many factors may affect the prices of hosing. These factors, as well as other parameters such as the materials used for building, number of bedrooms, living area, location, upcoming projects and proximity as was noted by Bourassa, Cantoni and Hoesli (2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction of housing sale price may be considered as an essential economic metric. The value of a house that grows with time requires the estimated value to be calculated as this value is required for sale, purchase or even mortgage. (Shinde and Gawande, 2018)."

    "1. Aswin (2017) applied 6 different machine learning models to predict house prices in data set with 2000 records and 10 features. The author used 6 machine learning algorithms ,such as Random Forest, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosted, Bagging, Support Vector Machine and Multiple Regression. The best accuracy performed Random Forest with R-squared value of 90%.\n",
    "2. Hujia Yu and Jiafu Wu (2016), also were working on a price prediction model. They created a regression and classification models which are able to estimate the price of the house given the features. It was concluded that for classification models the best model is Support Vector Classifier with linear kernel. The model showed an accuracy of 0.6740 and after PCA was performed on the dataset it increased to 0.6913. For regression problem, the best model is  Support Vector Regression with gaussian kernel, with RMSE of 0.5271.\n",
    "3. Ng A. (2015) explored the use of machine learning methods for London house price prediction. Approach is used to create local models by comparing various regression methods. Gaussian method was found to be most efficient because its probabilistic approach to learning and model selection.\n"

    "\n",
    "Each dataset behaves differently.A machine learning model may work with high accuracy in one dataset, but perform poorly in another despite both of them were applied to similar data. Social and ecomonic data s very dinamic in contrast to phisical or chimical where approved theory can be reviewed only in unique circumstances.\n",
    "This implies that data related to economy or social sector should be reviewed preferably as soon as new data has come.\n",
